This repository contains the code for

"**Control of  Nonholonomic Vehicles With Application to an  Underactuated 3-D Underwater Vehicle: A Lyapunov-Based  Method with  Assigned Nonlinear Behavior **" 

The simulink file **unicycle.slx** contains everything of 2-D case simulation in one file.
The simulink file **simulation_Hippocampus_compare_paper.slx** contains everything of 3-D case simulation in one file with the parameters file **parameters.m**.

The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:
- Windows 11 22H2
- Matlab 2022B
